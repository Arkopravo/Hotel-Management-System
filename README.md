Report on C++ Project - Hotel Management System

I am pleased to present a report on my C++ project, a Hotel Management System. 
The project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for managing room bookings and food orders in a hotel setting. 
It is designed to handle various aspects of hotel management, including room allocation, food item ordering, and tracking sales and collections.
